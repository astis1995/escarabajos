Zubov et al. (2019)\cite{zubov2019chrysina} describe a new species of Chrysina. In their comparative analysis and remarks, it is stated that the new species is very similar to C. resplendens, with only a few morphological differences being noted. This study aims to perform a quantitative analysis of these differences using a sample of 11 C. kalinini specimens and 23 C. resplendens specimens. The measurements described in the article are specified with greater precision, and alternative metrics are analyzed. Furthermore, the claims made in the mentioned paper are reviewed, assessing their validity and exploring new methods for differentiating the two beetle species with striking similarities.
