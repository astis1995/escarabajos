\section{Introduction}

Zubov et al. (2019) describe a new species of \textit{Chrysina}. In its comparative analysis, it is stated that the new species is very similar to \textit{C. resplendens} and only a few morphological differences can be noted. This work intends to perform a quantitative analysis of these differences using a sample of 11 \textit{C. kalinini} specimens and 23 \textit{C. resplendens} specimens.

The measurements described in the article are specified more precisely and alternative metrics are analyzed.
